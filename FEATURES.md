## Concept

There is no concept file yet it will soon be added

## Features

* Performs all kinds of operations that a normal calculator can do
* It uses version 3 for python
* Supports basic operations on types `int` and `float`
* The source code can be converted into any other programming languages like C# or ASP.NET or PHP or even Ruby
* Designed command-line interface
* 1<sup>st</sup> version of the application
* Supports operations of both floats and integers
* I have covered every single checks you can do for the a calculator
* Concept is based of from Windows 10 Calculator
* First python project I have ever done
* It is totally flexible all you have to do is to make changes to the following files
    * `basic_calculator.py` for changes to the basic calculator
    * `scientific_calculator.py` for changes to the scientific calculator
    * `programmer_calculator.py` for changes to the programmer calculator
    * `date_calculator.py` for changes to the date calculation script
    
## Usages

* Type `python main.py` on either the terminal or command-prompt of the repository
    * Type `basicCalculator` to perform only basic arithmetic operations
    * Type `scientificCalculator` to perform only advanced arithmetic calculations. **Doesn't include operation like (+ - * /) Use the basicCalculator instead**
    * Type `programmerCalculator` to perform computations for computer programming and also logic operations
    * Type `dateCalculationCalculator` to perform date calculations
    * Type `more` for more options of calculators
    * Type `help` for usage instructions of each calculator
